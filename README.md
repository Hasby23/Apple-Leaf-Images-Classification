# Apple Leaf Images Classification 

## Overview
Early identification of diseases affecting apple leaves is crucial for effective crop management. This research delves into the field of image classification for apple leaf diseases, using three different methodologies: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), pretrained CNN, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Focusing on apple leaves and evaluating these three methods, the study aims to provide valuable insights into the most effective techniques for identification.

## Dataset
The dataset for this study was sourced from a publicly available repository on GitHub, comprising images of apple leaves. The images were collected from diverse orchards, ensuring a representative sample of leaves in various conditions. The dataset includes four main categories:
1. Apple Scab
2. Black Rot
3. Cedar Apple Rust
4. Healthy
