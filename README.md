# Apple Leaf Images Classification 

## Overview
Early identification of diseases affecting apple leaves is crucial for effective crop management. This research delves into the field of image classification for apple leaf diseases, using three different methodologies: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), pretrained CNN, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Focusing on apple leaves and evaluating these three methods, the study aims to provide valuable insights into the most effective techniques for identification.
